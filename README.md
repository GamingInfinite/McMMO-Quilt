# McMMO Quilt
This is just a fun side project I had the idea to make, mainly because I play a lot of single player modded and I always thought that other mods that added a skill progression system were always either super OP or underwhelming.  Will finish this at some point when I either figure out how to develop for Quilt properly or when documentation for various systems becomes available.  The thing I'm trying to do is save player levels to the player, and I just can't figure it out.  If anyone has any recommendations on how to accomplish this feel free to make pull requests.  For obvious reasons this should be useable as a server mod as well, although I have no idea how this is supposed to work so.
